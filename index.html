				    <p>	Imagine a beautiful forest, filled with gorgeous looking trees. These trees had white bark reminiscent of birch and a rough feel to them. One pecularity of these trees is how they grow a downy and fluffy feeling leaf that could be used for a number of things such as clothes, tools, and more. In the forest lived a group of villagers who harvest the leaves for their own uses, tend to forest, and help maintain a perfectly balanced ecosystem. </p>

				    <p> Harvesting the leaf was tedious, and at times strenuous, for the villagers due to how the villagers harvested the leaves by plucking them from the treeâ€”and the villagers didn't want to cut down the trees because it might affect the enviorment. One day though, the forest inhabitants decided to just cut down a tree so that they could harvest the leaves faster. </p>

					<p> At first it seemed harmless, it was only a single tree and it would help take some stress off their lives. The villagers quickly fell down a slippery slope as one tree became two and two became three and so on. Soon after, the villagrs were chopping down trees by the hundreds and thousands and erecting processing factories that spewed out smog that would constantly bite at the nose and soot that would blacken the surrounding waters. It was only a matter of time before the entire land began to wither and in the end, the forest was nothing more than a husk, a shell of its former self.</p>

					<p> It was only one tree at first, but in life, all it takes is one thing before one finds oneself sliding down a path and reaching a point where there is no chance of turning back. Whether it be smoking, being wasteful, or cheating, all it takes is one instance to set one down a downward spiral.</p>
